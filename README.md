## OOP Basics :taco:
This is class eng-42 
# Objectives:
- Four Pillars:
    - <b>Abstraction</b>  - hiding complexities from the user and exposing only necessary parts so that it is readable/understandable. 
    
    An example would be using the microwave, you turn it on and place your food inside and know that it will do its function of heating up your food. We don't need to know about the particle vibrations that happens inside -- we jsut need to know our food will be warm. 
    
    - <b>Inheritance</b> - the ability to inherit behaviours and characteristics from a parent class. 
    
    
    - encapsuation
    - polymorphism 
 
 - Other learning objectives:
    -  Git + GitHub
    -  Documentation 
    -  Practices of organisation

 It is a specific example of a class. it is not the class. 
 
 ### Methods 
 Are functions that can be used by objects of a specific class.
 
 ### Class
